The code of the front-end consumer of the 2 REST APIs is in the `back_office` module. On this back-office, you can register, login, create and retrieve resources. After launching, you can access it at this URL: `http://localhost:5003`.

You can access the Swagger documentation of both APIs at the `/apidocs` URL.
